I was the most impressed with the pohodori bruschetta which just looks like chopped tomatoes on bread but the tomatoes had so much flavor that you couldn't even taste the tomato flavor. The burrata was great paired with the complimentary bread. The carrciofi was delicious paired with the garlic aioli that comes with it. The truffle oil was very fragrant and strong on the funghi bruschetta but it was a crowd favorite.

       " \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\",\n",

Just something to note, they explain the dishes so quickly in a thick Italian accent, which makes it really hard to understand.AMBIANCE: The ambiance of this place is so nice, the brick wall and the decor inside make this place a really nice date spot. The outdoor seating area also looks pretty.Overall, I probably won't come back unless if I'm tagging along with friends again.\",\n",
       " \"I recently dined at this charming restaurant. I must say, it was an amazing experience. From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed by the ambiance, complete with well-dimmed lighting that set the perfect romantic mood. My pasta dish was fantastic and bursting with flavor. The service was great, with attentive staff who made me feel welcomed and well taken care of, despite dining alone at the bar. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or any special occasion. I can't wait to return with friends - it left such a lasting impression that I would be back in a heartbeat. I'm excited to try additional plates. *After your meal there's an amazing bakery just across the street. It's a must try too!*\",\n",
       " 'Love this place, you can count on this place for good, hearty, consistent Italian food. Their price is very approachable for the quality of food you pay for. Tiramisu is great! Usually packed so make sure you account for the wait! We always come after 9 and can find seats quickly.',\n",
       " \"3.5/5 My friend discovered Bottega on a whim so he made a quick reservation on Resy. We were a party of 7 and at the time, their layout on the floor did not have a table for us but they were able to rearrange the tables to create a big enough table for us. They're very accommodating so we appreciated that. After a couple at the table next to us were done and left, the staff added their table to ours to create more space for us which worked out perfectly because 2 people in our party got added and it was just the right amount of table space. They have complimentary focaccia bread here with olive oil which we were very excited about. We ordered a few appetizers to start: funghi bruschetta, burrata aila caprese, pohodori bruschetta, and carciofi (artichoke hearts). All of these were great starters. I was the most impressed with the pohodori bruschetta which just looks like chopped tomatoes on bread but the tomatoes had so much flavor that you couldn't even taste the tomato flavor. The burrata was great paired with the complimentary bread. The carrciofi was delicious paired with the garlic aioli that comes with it. The truffle oil was very fragrant and strong on the funghi bruschetta but it was a crowd favorite. For the main dishes, I ordered the Spaghetti con Le Polpette which is your basic spaghetti and meatballs. I enjoyed the spaghetti noodles but thought the meatballs lacked something. My friends ordered the gnocchi in pink sauce and the meezelune al porcini and those were bomb. I enjoyed their dishes more than mine. The ambiance and service were pretty good though we did feel like the servers kept their eyes on us quite a lot near the end of our dinner. I definitely recommend to visit at least one time!\",\n",

It was well sun lit inside and we were seated immediately on a Sunday afternoon.We ended up getting the Gnocchi with Bolognese, the daily Pasta Special which included a variety of seafood with a tomato sauce (our personal favorite!) and the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with the pink sauce. The pastas were really tasty but we made the mistake of ordering 3 tomato based pastas instead of trying a white sauce haha. Another thing to note is that the Bolognese sauce is an additional cost! We ordered the Gnocchi thinking the Bolognese was one of the choices of sauces included in the price, as the menu doesn't make it clear, and it ended up being an additional $6 on top of the $19.\",\n",

Our server was great and super helpful and looked even confused why we were given a bottle before she arrived to our table. Ambiance was very nice and lots of decor.

It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out!

       " \"Bottega is a busy, colorful restaurant in the Mission offering a menu of Italian dishes including antipasti, pasta, and pinsa (Roman pizza). Our server Nicky (from Milan!) was super friendly and passionate about the food and gave us plenty of suggestions from the menu. We started with a basket of complimentary soft focaccia bread, followed by Burrata alla Caprese, a creamy round of Burrata cheese with arugula, basil, sliced tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar; Polpette al Sugo, homemade meatballs in tomato sauce; Cavoletti di Bruxelles, marinaded fried Brussels sprouts topped with pecorino; and Calamari Fritti, calamari and mixed vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini) fried in a farro flour batter and served with aioli for dipping. Of the appetizers, I especially liked the meatballs with tomato sauce (dipped with some bread), and the crunchy calamari and vegetables, but everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery.\",\n",
       " \"The interior of this restaurant is so beautiful! It was well sun lit inside and we were seated immediately on a Sunday afternoon.We ended up getting the Gnocchi with Bolognese, the daily Pasta Special which included a variety of seafood with a tomato sauce (our personal favorite!) and the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with the pink sauce. The pastas were really tasty but we made the mistake of ordering 3 tomato based pastas instead of trying a white sauce haha. Another thing to note is that the Bolognese sauce is an additional cost! We ordered the Gnocchi thinking the Bolognese was one of the choices of sauces included in the price, as the menu doesn't make it clear, and it ended up being an additional $6 on top of the $19.\",\n",

Instead of giving us regular table water they gave us a bottle when we first sat down and was charged for it without our knowledge. Felt sus. We had to pay it in the end bc we ended up drinking it. Our server was great and super helpful and looked even confused why we were given a bottle before she arrived to our table. Ambiance was very nice and lots of decor. Pasta was all fresh and delicious, one spaghetti and meatball dish our table ordered was a little undercooked but he didn't bring it up. Burrata and crab cakes were delicious. I had the rigatoni and it was great texture and flavor, the lobster ravioli was great in terms of sauce and texture. The margarita pizza was a little bit of a disappointment, it came out a regular cheese pizza instead with one basil leaf to distinguish it as such.\",\n",

Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out!

The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me.

       " \"Wow, wow, wow! Bottega blew me away with their amazing food and service. I went there with my wife on a Friday afternoon, and we had a blast. We got a window seat with a nice view of the street, and the hostess was super nice and helpful. She gave us some awesome recommendations, and we trusted her.The food was out of this world, some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It reminded me of my time in Florence, where I ate like a king. The hostess is Italian, so she knows her stuff. She doesn't serve any of that fake Americanized pasta that you find at some other places. She makes it fresh and authentic, just like mama used to make.We started with the vegetarian croquettes with black truffle sauce, which were crunchy and yummy. I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes. The service was fast and friendly, the interior was cozy and classy, and the ambience was lively and warm. I highly recommend Bottega to anyone who loves Italian food. It's a hidden gem in the city.\",\n",
       " \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\",\n",
       " \"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.\",\n",
       " 'this place is perfect for a date night or lunch out with friends! The Salmon fettuccine and prosciutto burrata pizza were great!

She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!\",\n",
       " \"Bottega is a busy, colorful restaurant in the Mission offering a menu of Italian dishes including antipasti, pasta, and pinsa (Roman pizza). Our server Nicky (from Milan!) was super friendly and passionate about the food and gave us plenty of suggestions from the menu. We started with a basket of complimentary soft focaccia bread, followed by Burrata alla Caprese, a creamy round of Burrata cheese with arugula, basil, sliced tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar; Polpette al Sugo, homemade meatballs in tomato sauce; Cavoletti di Bruxelles, marinaded fried Brussels sprouts topped with pecorino; and Calamari Fritti, calamari and mixed vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini) fried in a farro flour batter and served with aioli for dipping. Of the appetizers, I especially liked the meatballs with tomato sauce (dipped with some bread), and the crunchy calamari and vegetables, but everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery.\",\n",
       " \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor.

       " \"Bottega is a busy, colorful restaurant in the Mission offering a menu of Italian dishes including antipasti, pasta, and pinsa (Roman pizza). Our server Nicky (from Milan!) was super friendly and passionate about the food and gave us plenty of suggestions from the menu. We started with a basket of complimentary soft focaccia bread, followed by Burrata alla Caprese, a creamy round of Burrata cheese with arugula, basil, sliced tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar; Polpette al Sugo, homemade meatballs in tomato sauce; Cavoletti di Bruxelles, marinaded fried Brussels sprouts topped with pecorino; and Calamari Fritti, calamari and mixed vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini) fried in a farro flour batter and served with aioli for dipping. Of the appetizers, I especially liked the meatballs with tomato sauce (dipped with some bread), and the crunchy calamari and vegetables, but everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery.\",\n",
       " \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.\",\n",

I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me.

She doesn't serve any of that fake Americanized pasta that you find at some other places. She makes it fresh and authentic, just like mama used to make.We started with the vegetarian croquettes with black truffle sauce, which were crunchy and yummy. I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes.

Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit.\",\n",
       " \"Wow, wow, wow! Bottega blew me away with their amazing food and service. I went there with my wife on a Friday afternoon, and we had a blast. We got a window seat with a nice view of the street, and the hostess was super nice and helpful. She gave us some awesome recommendations, and we trusted her.The food was out of this world, some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It reminded me of my time in Florence, where I ate like a king. The hostess is Italian, so she knows her stuff. She doesn't serve any of that fake Americanized pasta that you find at some other places. She makes it fresh and authentic, just like mama used to make.We started with the vegetarian croquettes with black truffle sauce, which were crunchy and yummy. I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes. The service was fast and friendly, the interior was cozy and classy, and the ambience was lively and warm. I highly recommend Bottega to anyone who loves Italian food. It's a hidden gem in the city.\",\n",
       " \"I love taking my friends to Bottega- it's definitely one of my favorite spots for Italian in the city! I always leave feeling happy and satisfied with everything. Service is consistently good too. Food is absolutely amazing. I've tried the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce ($23) and I highly recommend it. The pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce is so creamy and flavorful. Love that you can omit the peas since I don't like them. I also got the Pomodori Bruschetta ($10), Milliefoglie alla Crema and Tiramisu (both $10) and they did not disappoint! Also, worth mentioning that the interior is spacious and well decorated. If you're looking for a great Italian spot in the city I definitely recommend checking Bottega out.\",\n",
       " \"This is one of my go to Italian places these days. It's great for any type of occasion. The pastas are one of the best in the city and the ambiance is very inviting. I always order the artichokes, but highly suggest getting the fungi pizza, salmon fettucini, or anything with their truffle sauce. The servers are also super nice and most of them are from Italy or somewhere in Europe. There can be a wait sometimes, but at least there's yelp waitlist!\",\n",

I don't recall everything we got, but I do remember my mom getting a seafood pasta dish. I had the lasagna, which was yummy. I liked my dad's dish more, though. He had the white truffle mushroom ravioli. The flavor was lighter compared to my dish, but you could definitely taste the truffle.

I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try!

       " \"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\",\n",

The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it.

Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth.

       " '- Calling this my #1 favorite Italian restaurant- Friendliest and most attentive staff- Seats available inside and outside the restaurant- Dishes appear small, but it is filling- What is that amazing spicy sauce?- Walking distance from the 24th Mission street BARTI have tried a few Italian restaurants before, but none has truly given me a wonderful experience like this one. Actually, I\\'ll compliment further, this was the best restaurant experience I ever had from any food category. The staff were the best at sharing us recommendations, special menus of the day, clearing the plates and tables, checking in from time to time to ask us if we are doing great, every aspect was so lovely.We arrived at the restaurant to have a delicious and good time, and Bottega delivered. I would like to give the rating 10+ stars if I could.Bottega has been in my bookmarks since I first saw the restaurant while walking around Valencia street. I love the warm and pretty interior decorations of flowers and the soft pink colors. I always recall the restaurant filled with people, so we decided to get there as early as possible. We entered 30 minutes after it opened and there were more seats than I last recall from my last visit in Valencia street. Along with tables, bar side tables, there is also outdoor seating.The staff welcomed us and asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside, and we opted for inside. The view from the inside is so pretty! The light from the outside is just right amount to filter through the tall windows. The staff handed us a menu; the front side is the food and the other side was the alcoholic drinks. I did wonder, hm, where is the coffee and the dessert, but that was well orchestrated by Bottega.While we were deciding, the staff mentioned about a special menu of minestrone soup or the pork chop, and we were intrigued with the minestrone soup. We ordered three dishes the Amatriciana, the prosciutto pizza (saw this from yelp photos), and the minestrone soup. As the food was being prepared, the staff asked if we were planning to share the dishes, and explained the unbelievably long pepper grinder we witnessed from a different guest.The minestrone arrived first and then the Amatriciana pasta. The staff came by and asked if we wanted more cheese, pepper, or the spicy sauce on the side. We asked for the spicy sauce on the side -- and yes, we needed to ask for more pepper. The pepper grinding was so cool and fun to stare at. xD I have a pepper grinder at home, but this one was almost as tall as a young child. Where did they sell these?The minestrone soup was very smooth and rich with flavor. My relative, who loves dishes with vegetables, praised this a lot and really enjoyed this soup. The vegetables in the broth were cooked so well, so soft, that light bites were enough. I might have wished we ordered another bowl, so we\\'ll keep that in mind for next time.I was blown away with the spicy sauce when paired with the Amatriciana. What is that magic? There is a drastically amazing difference when tasting the pasta before adding the spicy sauce versus after. Before, it is good, but it also felt hefty. I sprinkled a little bit of the spicy sauce, and all of the sudden the flavors elevated and the dish became refreshing? It was like a magic transformation. Also, despite calling it the spicy sauce, it wasn\\'t spicy even for me, who has low spice tolerance. The pasta noodle was cooked al dente, so there was an evenly smooth chew on each bite. The prosciutto pizza arrived while we were still eating and being amazed by the Amatriciana and the minestrone soup. It was cut in 8 pieces and each slice has prosciutto, cheese, and a cream that was particularly my favorite. It was milky and balanced out the salt from the prosciutto. On the first bite, I first tasted the salt, but it evened out in the end of the meal. Due to how thin the prosciutto is, this one was the hardest to eat out of the others. Prosciutto is not an easy piece to eat.We were feeling full, when the staff handed a petite dessert menu. Now, before this arrived, I told my family that if they offer me a dessert I will say \"yes,\" So, yes, we ordered dessert. Here, the staff explained the different desserts and pointed out the staff\\'s favorite. I decided to go for the staff favorite, which was the third one in the list, after the panna cotta. (I tried my best to look by the search engine but I couldn\\'t remember what it was called). We also ordered the panna cotta.The panna cotta was so good, the cream is so milky and melt into the mouth. I loved it a lot. Strawberry puree covered the top and the slightly sour and sweet strawberry complimented perfectly with it. Man, it was crazy because we were full moments ago, but the heaviness disappeared the moment we took a bite of the desserts.I also loved the other dessert. It is slightly heavier than the panna cotta, and I love the yellow custard.Yelp told me I\\'m at my word limit.',\n",

The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\",\n",
       " 'Love the food, ambiance and the service. Recommend the pink sauce pasta. Best place to celebrate your anniversary or bdays or any special occasion.',\n",
       " \"Came here on a weekend for a late lunch. We had a group of 6 people and each of us ordered a different pasta, which was quite funny. We also got two dishes of the croquette (forgot what filling it had but it's pretty tasty!). I really like the interior (classy designs, big windows) too. Parking was not too bad (found some street parking on the block behind the store). Overall we had a good time dining here!\",\n",
       " '- Calling this my #1 favorite Italian restaurant- Friendliest and most attentive staff- Seats available inside and outside the restaurant- Dishes appear small, but it is filling- What is that amazing spicy sauce?- Walking distance from the 24th Mission street BARTI have tried a few Italian restaurants before, but none has truly given me a wonderful experience like this one. Actually, I\\'ll compliment further, this was the best restaurant experience I ever had from any food category. The staff were the best at sharing us recommendations, special menus of the day, clearing the plates and tables, checking in from time to time to ask us if we are doing great, every aspect was so lovely.We arrived at the restaurant to have a delicious and good time, and Bottega delivered. I would like to give the rating 10+ stars if I could.Bottega has been in my bookmarks since I first saw the restaurant while walking around Valencia street. I love the warm and pretty interior decorations of flowers and the soft pink colors. I always recall the restaurant filled with people, so we decided to get there as early as possible. We entered 30 minutes after it opened and there were more seats than I last recall from my last visit in Valencia street. Along with tables, bar side tables, there is also outdoor seating.The staff welcomed us and asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside, and we opted for inside. The view from the inside is so pretty! The light from the outside is just right amount to filter through the tall windows. The staff handed us a menu; the front side is the food and the other side was the alcoholic drinks. I did wonder, hm, where is the coffee and the dessert, but that was well orchestrated by Bottega.While we were deciding, the staff mentioned about a special menu of minestrone soup or the pork chop, and we were intrigued with the minestrone soup. We ordered three dishes the Amatriciana, the prosciutto pizza (saw this from yelp photos), and the minestrone soup. As the food was being prepared, the staff asked if we were planning to share the dishes, and explained the unbelievably long pepper grinder we witnessed from a different guest.The minestrone arrived first and then the Amatriciana pasta. The staff came by and asked if we wanted more cheese, pepper, or the spicy sauce on the side. We asked for the spicy sauce on the side -- and yes, we needed to ask for more pepper. The pepper grinding was so cool and fun to stare at. xD I have a pepper grinder at home, but this one was almost as tall as a young child. Where did they sell these?The minestrone soup was very smooth and rich with flavor. My relative, who loves dishes with vegetables, praised this a lot and really enjoyed this soup. The vegetables in the broth were cooked so well, so soft, that light bites were enough. I might have wished we ordered another bowl, so we\\'ll keep that in mind for next time.I was blown away with the spicy sauce when paired with the Amatriciana. What is that magic? There is a drastically amazing difference when tasting the pasta before adding the spicy sauce versus after. Before, it is good, but it also felt hefty. I sprinkled a little bit of the spicy sauce, and all of the sudden the flavors elevated and the dish became refreshing? It was like a magic transformation. Also, despite calling it the spicy sauce, it wasn\\'t spicy even for me, who has low spice tolerance. The pasta noodle was cooked al dente, so there was an evenly smooth chew on each bite. The prosciutto pizza arrived while we were still eating and being amazed by the Amatriciana and the minestrone soup. It was cut in 8 pieces and each slice has prosciutto, cheese, and a cream that was particularly my favorite. It was milky and balanced out the salt from the prosciutto. On the first bite, I first tasted the salt, but it evened out in the end of the meal. Due to how thin the prosciutto is, this one was the hardest to eat out of the others. Prosciutto is not an easy piece to eat.We were feeling full, when the staff handed a petite dessert menu. Now, before this arrived, I told my family that if they offer me a dessert I will say \"yes,\" So, yes, we ordered dessert. Here, the staff explained the different desserts and pointed out the staff\\'s favorite. I decided to go for the staff favorite, which was the third one in the list, after the panna cotta. (I tried my best to look by the search engine but I couldn\\'t remember what it was called). We also ordered the panna cotta.The panna cotta was so good, the cream is so milky and melt into the mouth. I loved it a lot. Strawberry puree covered the top and the slightly sour and sweet strawberry complimented perfectly with it. Man, it was crazy because we were full moments ago, but the heaviness disappeared the moment we took a bite of the desserts.I also loved the other dessert. It is slightly heavier than the panna cotta, and I love the yellow custard.Yelp told me I\\'m at my word limit.',\n",
       " \"Amazing! We wanted a good meal after attending an event and was happy to have discovered this place as a late night eatery. So glad I found it on Yelp because it did not disappoint! We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and was able to grab a seat instantly. They have indoor or outdoor seating, we chose inside. The ambiance is super cute with the pendant lights and floral decor. Even the dining chairs were cute. For drinks I ordered a sparking ros√®. It was perfect, not too sweet, not too brut. To start we shared a ceasar salad. We told them that we wanted to share and they split it for us on two separate plates! That was super helpful and we definitely made note. I ordered the black truffle mushroom ravioli. It was great!!! I'm glad the hosts provided me with an idea on how good it would be. His recommendation did not disappoint. The flavor of the truffle was strong, which I like! The mushrooms were minced and paired good with the sauce and truffle. Highly recommend! Overall I will be dining here again for sure. Parking is limited to street but luckily I didn't have any issues finding one close by.\"]"

       " 'Ordered the gnocchi with bolognese sauce but the menu fails to mention that it costs $6 extra for the sauce. I did not build my own pasta which states the pasta and sauce price, so I was extremely annoyed to see I was charged unknowingly for sauce.

       " 'As a native Italian, food is very important. Whenever I am in the US, I always fret when i see \"Italian\" restaurants around. Yet, at Bottega, I felt as if I was back home! Not only was the food absolutely pristine but it was at the same level as my nonna\\'s cooking, which is much to say (don\\'t let her know i said that). Furthermore, the service was excellent, with native Italian waiters and super friendly staff (shout out to the mito, Valerio). That night I went, I wanted to give my American girlfriend a touch of my home for our anniversary, and this place did that, and much more. Grazie :)',\n",
       " \"This place is super cute and spacious. On Sunday lunch, we were seated right away and the place wasn't crowded. Nice quiet place to have conversations over delicious pasta. After one bite of their pasta, I ENTERED MY PASTA ERA. I was craving it every day after that for weeks! Their pasta menu is pretty simple, back to the basics, but they nail it down so well. Both the spaghetti and fettuccine noodles were al dante and both the red and the pink sauce was so flavorful and so good. Not too salty or heavy. Fettuccine + Pink Sauce + Chicken - This was my dish, it was so good. Perfect noodles and perfect sauce. Chicken was kinda dry, I should have opted for salmon next time. Spaghetti + Red Sauce + Meatballs - Both of my friends got this! So I definitely had a few bites. Perfect noodles and sauce. They said the meatballs were really good!Caprese salad - The burrata is so creamy. Great salad to share on the side. It went really well with the complimentary bread.\",\n",
       " 'If you were to visit, place yourself on Yelp Waitlist before leaving. It will save you time waiting outside the restaurant. My boyfriend and I were seated 10 minutes after our check-in time. They situated us down with the menu, water and bread. We placed our order shortly after, but this was the end of our peace...One server came out with \"our\" food, but it was not. We politely told him it was not ours because he said it was a gluten-free pasta, which neither of us ordered. However, he tried to tell us that this is what we ordered and we were wrong. After a quick conversation, he took the pasta away. Another server came by after to give us our food, which was close to right (right pasta wrong sauce). However, we didnt want to deal with the previous conversation again, so we went along with the dishes as it was almost right. When we received our check, we noticed that we were charged for pesto sauce (PLEASE LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND LET ME KNOW WHICH ONE IS PESTO SAUCE BECAUSE EVIDENTLY I DONT KNOW MY COLORS). We tried to tell the server of the mistake, which he just dismissed it by saying it will be the same price regardless (which is incorrect as we verified online that the fee only applies if it is a pesto sauce)The food also doesn\\'t  justify the poor service: - Bread (3/5) - decent, but cold and soggy - Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce (4/5) - too many peas and flavor was a bit salty to my liking - Gnocchi with pink sauce (2/5) - honestly Trader Joes does it better If it wasn\\'t for the service, this place could be better...',\n",
       " \"Such a cute place and easy to get on the waitlist especially on a Friday night. To be honest, I was not impressed with the food. The staff was a bit slow whereas I honestly rate it a 3.5, but 4 for effort and being full. Espresso martinis: 5/5 can't go wrong ever. Calamari: 3/5 had too much salt, but was breaded nicely. Bruschetta: 4/5 it was okay and had lots of ingredients. Pizza: this was the best dish. I can't remember which one it was but it was so flavorful and super cheesy. Loved how crispy the crust was. 5/5Gnocchi: 3/5 pasta was okay. Maybe it's me and thought it wasn't anything special. Tiramisu: 5/5 this was amazing! Overall, the pizza and tiramisu were really good! It's a cute spot for a date night, a night out, or celebration.\",\n",
       " \"Probably one of the most aesthetic Italian places they have super cute floral walls. It's perfect for a casual date night or a girls night Highlights:  gluten free penne with arrabiata sauce & meatballs: love the option to customize your pasta the arrabiata sauce I wish had more kick Overall a cute place to go but I wouldn't say is mind blowing or anything like that. It does classic Italian food well though!Service was a bit spotty though it was hard to wave down a waiter to get extra pepper & the check.\",\n",
       " \"Great service, good Italian food. Ordered the calamari to start, but wish there was more calamari than veggies. I wouldn't order again. The 4 cheese pasta with walnut gorgonzola was really rich, cooked al dente. The pink sauce Mezzemaniche was super flavorful, but the meat was slightly too salty. Be sure to ask for cheese and red pepper flakes!\",\n",
       " \"Food: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5Price: 4/5Atmosphere: 4/5A really cute & well decorated Italian restaurant but I don't think Bottega lives up to the hype it gets, or it could be that we had a bad experience when we went. The service was great -- the servers were fairly nice but slow. For the price, we expected better. We actually enjoyed the appetizers much more than the different pastas we got.For apps, we got the bruschetta, garlic bread, burrata caprese, & waffle fries. All of these were really tasty, the bread was fresh and toast. The waffle fries were also surprisingly super good -- really crispy and the truffle flavor does stand out.For entrees, we got the Spaghetti, Chicken Alfredo, & Mezzemaniche Boscaiola w/ Pink Sauce.The pink sauce pasta was the best by far, really flavorful & saucy. The sausage was seasoned well and there was a lot, and the pasta was cooked al dente.The Spaghetti, while the sauce was & meatballs were good, the pasta was undercooked. Half the pieces were able to be snapped. When we told the server, they kept telling us that it was cooked al dente -- but it was still kind of crunchy and when you bite it, the middle is clearly way too starchy like it hasn't been cooked through. Eventually they remade it for us and it did taste better. But we didn't enjoy how they were trying to convince us that we just didn't understand what al dente pasta is.The Chicken Alfredo was just bland. It was creamy but there was no flavor to it. I had to add more salt on my own, but the pasta itself was cooked really well.Overall, I would come back here if a friend wanted to eat here or someone else had a celebratory meal here, but I probably wouldn't choose to come back on my own. For the price & service, there are better Italian restaurants in SF.\",\n",
       " 'The food was good! We got the eggplant parm and the chicken parm which was good and full of flavor. The calamari was also delicious and crispy. We got espresso martinis for our choice of drinks and it was so yummy and perfectly made. The service was great and friendly.
