0,The food was good! We got the eggplant parm and the chicken parm which was good and full of flavor. The calamari was also delicious and crispy. We got espresso martinis for our choice of drinks and it was so yummy and perfectly made. The service was great and friendly. It was such a cute vibe - felt like we were in an half outdoor restaurant with fresh air coming in.
1,"I rarely eat Italian food, but for some odd reason, I was really craving some pasta! Thankfully, my boyfriend is always down to try new restos with me, so we decided to venture to Bottega for a nice and romantic Valentine's Day dinner.The food here was PHENOMENAL. We started off with complimentary foccacia, which was warm, toasted, and flavorful. We then split a spaghetti and meatball dish plus a branzino plate (which our server split into two dishes for us without even asking!) As previous Yelpers have mentioned, Bottega nails the al dente game. I instantly fell in love with the bite and chew of their spaghetti pasta, and I thought the meatballs were both juicy and tender. I also have nothing but fabulous things to say about their branzino. My favorite part was the crispy skin!Even when we're not celebrating Valentine's Day, I would gladly take my boyfriend back here for even a casual dinner out. Bottega exceeded my expectations, and I can't wait for the next opportunity to go back!"

6,"3.5/5 My friend discovered Bottega on a whim so he made a quick reservation on Resy. We were a party of 7 and at the time, their layout on the floor did not have a table for us but they were able to rearrange the tables to create a big enough table for us. They're very accommodating so we appreciated that. After a couple at the table next to us were done and left, the staff added their table to ours to create more space for us which worked out perfectly because 2 people in our party got added and it was just the right amount of table space. They have complimentary focaccia bread here with olive oil which we were very excited about. We ordered a few appetizers to start: funghi bruschetta, burrata aila caprese, pohodori bruschetta, and carciofi (artichoke hearts). All of these were great starters. I was the most impressed with the pohodori bruschetta which just looks like chopped tomatoes on bread but the tomatoes had so much flavor that you couldn't even taste the tomato flavor. The burrata was great paired with the complimentary bread. The carrciofi was delicious paired with the garlic aioli that comes with it. The truffle oil was very fragrant and strong on the funghi bruschetta but it was a crowd favorite. For the main dishes, I ordered the Spaghetti con Le Polpette which is your basic spaghetti and meatballs. I enjoyed the spaghetti noodles but thought the meatballs lacked something. My friends ordered the gnocchi in pink sauce and the meezelune al porcini and those were bomb. I enjoyed their dishes more than mine.

Our server was great and super helpful and looked even confused why we were given a bottle before she arrived to our table. Ambiance was very nice and lots of decor. Pasta was all fresh and delicious, one spaghetti and meatball dish our table ordered was a little undercooked but he didn't bring it up. Burrata and crab cakes were delicious. I had the rigatoni and it was great texture and flavor, the lobster ravioli was great in terms of sauce and texture. The margarita pizza was a little bit of a disappointment, it came out a regular cheese pizza instead with one basil leaf to distinguish it as such."

29,"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you."

Instead of giving us regular table water they gave us a bottle when we first sat down and was charged for it without our knowledge. Felt sus. We had to pay it in the end bc we ended up drinking it. Our server was great and super helpful and looked even confused why we were given a bottle before she arrived to our table. Ambiance was very nice and lots of decor. Pasta was all fresh and delicious, one spaghetti and meatball dish our table ordered was a little undercooked but he didn't bring it up. Burrata and crab cakes were delicious. I had the rigatoni and it was great texture and flavor, the lobster ravioli was great in terms of sauce and texture. The margarita pizza was a little bit of a disappointment, it came out a regular cheese pizza instead with one basil leaf to distinguish it as such."
36,"I came to visit Bottega for a date night. It was our first time at the restaurant and we ordered the pasta. We were about to try a build your own pasta and the waiter recommended that the combinations we had simply did not work. Since they were confident on their word, we asked for a recommendation and opted for the salmon fettuccini. We paired it with some wine. Delicious pasta and very true italian food. The pasta was fresh to the point it was probably made in house. I was so full off of half of the plate; my boyfriend finished his order. The ambiance is quite picturesque and great for a date night"
37,"Quality food and quality time. The ambiance and service is top tier. This place almost felt hidden and tucked away, which was relaxing.Ordered the burrata, calamari and truffle fries for an appetizer. For our main dishes we shared the chicken Parmesan & lobster ravioli.Appetizers were all great. The calamari was the best of course, just a tad bit salty! The star of the show for me was the chicken Parmesan. I will 10000% be back for that dish alone if not just to feel tucked away in the city.I would skip the lobster ravioli. The pasta was undercooked, not too much lobster for the cost."
38,"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you."
39,"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience."
40,"I recently dined at this charming restaurant. I must say, it was an amazing experience. From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed by the ambiance, complete with well-dimmed lighting that set the perfect romantic mood. My pasta dish was fantastic and bursting with flavor. The service was great, with attentive staff who made me feel welcomed and well taken care of, despite dining alone at the bar. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or any special occasion. I can't wait to return with friends - it left such a lasting impression that I would be back in a heartbeat. I'm excited to try additional plates. *After your meal there's an amazing bakery just across the street. It's a must try too!*"
41,"Love this place, you can count on this place for good, hearty, consistent Italian food. Their price is very approachable for the quality of food you pay for. Tiramisu is great! Usually packed so make sure you account for the wait! We always come after 9 and can find seats quickly."
42,"3.5/5 My friend discovered Bottega on a whim so he made a quick reservation on Resy. We were a party of 7 and at the time, their layout on the floor did not have a table for us but they were able to rearrange the tables to create a big enough table for us. They're very accommodating so we appreciated that. After a couple at the table next to us were done and left, the staff added their table to ours to create more space for us which worked out perfectly because 2 people in our party got added and it was just the right amount of table space. They have complimentary focaccia bread here with olive oil which we were very excited about. We ordered a few appetizers to start: funghi bruschetta, burrata aila caprese, pohodori bruschetta, and carciofi (artichoke hearts). All of these were great starters. I was the most impressed with the pohodori bruschetta which just looks like chopped tomatoes on bread but the tomatoes had so much flavor that you couldn't even taste the tomato flavor. The burrata was great paired with the complimentary bread. The carrciofi was delicious paired with the garlic aioli that comes with it. The truffle oil was very fragrant and strong on the funghi bruschetta but it was a crowd favorite. For the main dishes, I ordered the Spaghetti con Le Polpette which is your basic spaghetti and meatballs. I enjoyed the spaghetti noodles but thought the meatballs lacked something. My friends ordered the gnocchi in pink sauce and the meezelune al porcini and those were bomb. I enjoyed their dishes more than mine. The ambiance and service were pretty good though we did feel like the servers kept their eyes on us quite a lot near the end of our dinner. I definitely recommend to visit at least one time!"
43,"The interior of this restaurant is so beautiful! It was well sun lit inside and we were seated immediately on a Sunday afternoon.We ended up getting the Gnocchi with Bolognese, the daily Pasta Special which included a variety of seafood with a tomato sauce (our personal favorite!) and the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with the pink sauce. The pastas were really tasty but we made the mistake of ordering 3 tomato based pastas instead of trying a white sauce haha. Another thing to note is that the Bolognese sauce is an additional cost!

69,"Bottega is a busy, colorful restaurant in the Mission offering a menu of Italian dishes including antipasti, pasta, and pinsa (Roman pizza). Our server Nicky (from Milan!) was super friendly and passionate about the food and gave us plenty of suggestions from the menu. We started with a basket of complimentary soft focaccia bread, followed by Burrata alla Caprese, a creamy round of Burrata cheese with arugula, basil, sliced tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar; Polpette al Sugo, homemade meatballs in tomato sauce; Cavoletti di Bruxelles, marinaded fried Brussels sprouts topped with pecorino; and Calamari Fritti, calamari and mixed vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini) fried in a farro flour batter and served with aioli for dipping. Of the appetizers, I especially liked the meatballs with tomato sauce (dipped with some bread), and the crunchy calamari and vegetables, but everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery."

I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you."
75,"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience."
76,"this place is perfect for a date night or lunch out with friends! The Salmon fettuccine and prosciutto burrata pizza were great! We had a big party of 18 and they were able to accommodate us since we called and made a reservation ahead. The staff here is amazing, friendly and helpful! the restaurant is decorated very nicely. Definitely recommend this place!"
77,"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!"
78,"Bottega is a busy, colorful restaurant in the Mission offering a menu of Italian dishes including antipasti, pasta, and pinsa (Roman pizza). Our server Nicky (from Milan!) was super friendly and passionate about the food and gave us plenty of suggestions from the menu. We started with a basket of complimentary soft focaccia bread, followed by Burrata alla Caprese, a creamy round of Burrata cheese with arugula, basil, sliced tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar; Polpette al Sugo, homemade meatballs in tomato sauce; Cavoletti di Bruxelles, marinaded fried Brussels sprouts topped with pecorino; and Calamari Fritti, calamari and mixed vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini) fried in a farro flour batter and served with aioli for dipping. Of the appetizers, I especially liked the meatballs with tomato sauce (dipped with some bread), and the crunchy calamari and vegetables, but everything was delicious and beautifully presented. The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery."
79,"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it."
80,"Ambiance :5/5Food:3.5/5Service: 5/5Food came out accordingly but I feel that the busser or table runners planned to charge us for water. Instead of giving us regular table water they gave us a bottle when we first sat down and was charged for it without our knowledge. Felt sus. We had to pay it in the end bc we ended up drinking it. Our server was great and super helpful and looked even confused why we were given a bottle before she arrived to our table. Ambiance was very nice and lots of decor. Pasta was all fresh and delicious, one spaghetti and meatball dish our table ordered was a little undercooked but he didn't bring it up. Burrata and crab cakes were delicious. I had the rigatoni and it was great texture and flavor, the lobster ravioli was great in terms of sauce and texture. The margarita pizza was a little bit of a disappointment, it came out a regular cheese pizza instead with one basil leaf to distinguish it as such."
81,"I came to visit Bottega for a date night. It was our first time at the restaurant and we ordered the pasta. We were about to try a build your own pasta and the waiter recommended that the combinations we had simply did not work. Since they were confident on their word, we asked for a recommendation and opted for the salmon fettuccini. We paired it with some wine. Delicious pasta and very true italian food. The pasta was fresh to the point it was probably made in house. I was so full off of half of the plate; my boyfriend finished his order. The ambiance is quite picturesque and great for a date night"
82,"Quality food and quality time. The ambiance and service is top tier. This place almost felt hidden and tucked away, which was relaxing.Ordered the burrata, calamari and truffle fries for an appetizer. For our main dishes we shared the chicken Parmesan & lobster ravioli.Appetizers were all great. The calamari was the best of course, just a tad bit salty! The star of the show for me was the chicken Parmesan. I will 10000% be back for that dish alone if not just to feel tucked away in the city.I would skip the lobster ravioli. The pasta was undercooked, not too much lobster for the cost."
83,"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out!

89,"I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!"

109,"Wow, wow, wow! Bottega blew me away with their amazing food and service. I went there with my wife on a Friday afternoon, and we had a blast. We got a window seat with a nice view of the street, and the hostess was super nice and helpful. She gave us some awesome recommendations, and we trusted her.The food was out of this world, some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It reminded me of my time in Florence, where I ate like a king. The hostess is Italian, so she knows her stuff. She doesn't serve any of that fake Americanized pasta that you find at some other places. She makes it fresh and authentic, just like mama used to make.We started with the vegetarian croquettes with black truffle sauce, which were crunchy and yummy. I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes. The service was fast and friendly, the interior was cozy and classy, and the ambience was lively and warm. I highly recommend Bottega to anyone who loves Italian food. It's a hidden gem in the city."

The theme of our entrees was truffles, and I tried the Fettuccine with Black Truffle Cream, and the Tartufata Pinsa, a Roman-style pizza made with a light, airy, crispy crust topped with fior di latte, wild mushrooms, black truffle cream, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. This pizza was pure decadence, and the deep truffle aroma paired perfectly with the unctuous, umami cheese! Overall, this was a great restaurant with a fun vibe, delicious food, and reasonable prices. They don't take reservations, but it wasn't hard to snag a table at this casual eatery."
115,"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it."
116,"I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!"
117,Pizza here is one of the best out in the mission! Make sure to get the lasagna instead though because this will blow your mind awayyyy
118,"Wow, wow, wow! Bottega blew me away with their amazing food and service. I went there with my wife on a Friday afternoon, and we had a blast. We got a window seat with a nice view of the street, and the hostess was super nice and helpful. She gave us some awesome recommendations, and we trusted her.The food was out of this world, some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It reminded me of my time in Florence, where I ate like a king. The hostess is Italian, so she knows her stuff. She doesn't serve any of that fake Americanized pasta that you find at some other places. She makes it fresh and authentic, just like mama used to make.We started with the vegetarian croquettes with black truffle sauce, which were crunchy and yummy. I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes. The service was fast and friendly, the interior was cozy and classy, and the ambience was lively and warm. I highly recommend Bottega to anyone who loves Italian food. It's a hidden gem in the city."
119,"I love taking my friends to Bottega- it's definitely one of my favorite spots for Italian in the city! I always leave feeling happy and satisfied with everything. Service is consistently good too. Food is absolutely amazing. I've tried the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce ($23) and I highly recommend it. The pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce is so creamy and flavorful. Love that you can omit the peas since I don't like them. I also got the Pomodori Bruschetta ($10), Milliefoglie alla Crema and Tiramisu (both $10) and they did not disappoint! Also, worth mentioning that the interior is spacious and well decorated. If you're looking for a great Italian spot in the city I definitely recommend checking Bottega out."
120,"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience."
121,"this place is perfect for a date night or lunch out with friends! The Salmon fettuccine and prosciutto burrata pizza were great! We had a big party of 18 and they were able to accommodate us since we called and made a reservation ahead. The staff here is amazing, friendly and helpful! the restaurant is decorated very nicely. Definitely recommend this place!"
122,"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!"

149,"I came here for Christmas Eve Dinner. Ambience on point. Loved the decor. Seats were a little uncomfortable (metal wire? With no cushions).The staff were very nice. We were seated quickly despite not having a prior reservation. Our server was attentive and helpful, offering to take a picture for us and going to far as to get the perfect lighting for the picture. He was a great help when we were deciding on our order.The focaccia was amazing. Hands down the best I've ever had. The entire table gobbled everything up, and we probably got 2 refills. I don't recall which drink I had, but both my brothers and my own were non-alcoholic (got different ones). We loved both. My dad got the espresso martini, which he enjoyed. I don't recall everything we got, but I do remember my mom getting a seafood pasta dish. I had the lasagna, which was yummy. I liked my dad's dish more, though. He had the white truffle mushroom ravioli. The flavor was lighter compared to my dish, but you could definitely taste the truffle. I think we got the crab cakes (also good), and I really want to say my brother had the risotto.Parking was pretty easy, we got a spot on the same block. The restaurant wasn't horribly busy, either."

I usually don't like black truffle, but this sauce was the bomb. Then we had the rigatoni arabiatta and the pesto rigatoni with burrata. Both dishes were heavenly, with fresh tomatoes, handmade pasta, and spicy and fragrant sauces. The burrata was creamy and dreamy, and went well with the pesto.We were too stuffed for dessert, but we will definitely come back to try more dishes. The service was fast and friendly, the interior was cozy and classy, and the ambience was lively and warm. I highly recommend Bottega to anyone who loves Italian food. It's a hidden gem in the city."
155,"I love taking my friends to Bottega- it's definitely one of my favorite spots for Italian in the city! I always leave feeling happy and satisfied with everything. Service is consistently good too. Food is absolutely amazing. I've tried the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce ($23) and I highly recommend it. The pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce is so creamy and flavorful. Love that you can omit the peas since I don't like them. I also got the Pomodori Bruschetta ($10), Milliefoglie alla Crema and Tiramisu (both $10) and they did not disappoint! Also, worth mentioning that the interior is spacious and well decorated. If you're looking for a great Italian spot in the city I definitely recommend checking Bottega out."
156,"This is one of my go to Italian places these days. It's great for any type of occasion. The pastas are one of the best in the city and the ambiance is very inviting. I always order the artichokes, but highly suggest getting the fungi pizza, salmon fettucini, or anything with their truffle sauce. The servers are also super nice and most of them are from Italy or somewhere in Europe. There can be a wait sometimes, but at least there's yelp waitlist!"
157,"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!"
158,"I came here for Christmas Eve Dinner. Ambience on point. Loved the decor. Seats were a little uncomfortable (metal wire? With no cushions).The staff were very nice. We were seated quickly despite not having a prior reservation. Our server was attentive and helpful, offering to take a picture for us and going to far as to get the perfect lighting for the picture. He was a great help when we were deciding on our order.The focaccia was amazing. Hands down the best I've ever had. The entire table gobbled everything up, and we probably got 2 refills. I don't recall which drink I had, but both my brothers and my own were non-alcoholic (got different ones). We loved both. My dad got the espresso martini, which he enjoyed. I don't recall everything we got, but I do remember my mom getting a seafood pasta dish. I had the lasagna, which was yummy. I liked my dad's dish more, though. He had the white truffle mushroom ravioli. The flavor was lighter compared to my dish, but you could definitely taste the truffle. I think we got the crab cakes (also good), and I really want to say my brother had the risotto.Parking was pretty easy, we got a spot on the same block. The restaurant wasn't horribly busy, either."
159,"Very good restaurant! I ordered the lobster ravioli which was really good, and was also a big fan of both the bruschetta and calamari. I thought the brussel sprouts were just okay, and also thought the (free) bread was not very good (but again, it's free so can't complain too much there). The service was fantastic though - great recommendations on both wine and food, and incredibly kind and attentive! It's also a nice space, great for dinner with friends or a date night."
160,"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it."
161,"I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!"

189,"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit."

I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit."
199,"The two times I've been here the pasta, bread and wine has been amazing. The first time I came here I got the truffle pasta. The second time I came here for a girls day early dinner. I got the walnut and pear tortellini and the truffle pizza it was amazing! My lovely date and i got an aperol sprit"
200,"I love taking my friends to Bottega- it's definitely one of my favorite spots for Italian in the city! I always leave feeling happy and satisfied with everything. Service is consistently good too. Food is absolutely amazing. I've tried the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce ($23) and I highly recommend it. The pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce is so creamy and flavorful. Love that you can omit the peas since I don't like them. I also got the Pomodori Bruschetta ($10), Milliefoglie alla Crema and Tiramisu (both $10) and they did not disappoint! Also, worth mentioning that the interior is spacious and well decorated. If you're looking for a great Italian spot in the city I definitely recommend checking Bottega out."
201,"This is one of my go to Italian places these days. It's great for any type of occasion. The pastas are one of the best in the city and the ambiance is very inviting. I always order the artichokes, but highly suggest getting the fungi pizza, salmon fettucini, or anything with their truffle sauce. The servers are also super nice and most of them are from Italy or somewhere in Europe. There can be a wait sometimes, but at least there's yelp waitlist!"
202,"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!"
203,"I came here for Christmas Eve Dinner. Ambience on point. Loved the decor. Seats were a little uncomfortable (metal wire? With no cushions).The staff were very nice. We were seated quickly despite not having a prior reservation. Our server was attentive and helpful, offering to take a picture for us and going to far as to get the perfect lighting for the picture. He was a great help when we were deciding on our order.The focaccia was amazing. Hands down the best I've ever had. The entire table gobbled everything up, and we probably got 2 refills. I don't recall which drink I had, but both my brothers and my own were non-alcoholic (got different ones). We loved both. My dad got the espresso martini, which he enjoyed. I don't recall everything we got, but I do remember my mom getting a seafood pasta dish. I had the lasagna, which was yummy. I liked my dad's dish more, though. He had the white truffle mushroom ravioli. The flavor was lighter compared to my dish, but you could definitely taste the truffle. I think we got the crab cakes (also good), and I really want to say my brother had the risotto.Parking was pretty easy, we got a spot on the same block. The restaurant wasn't horribly busy, either."
204,"Very good restaurant! I ordered the lobster ravioli which was really good, and was also a big fan of both the bruschetta and calamari. I thought the brussel sprouts were just okay, and also thought the (free) bread was not very good (but again, it's free so can't complain too much there). The service was fantastic though - great recommendations on both wine and food, and incredibly kind and attentive! It's also a nice space, great for dinner with friends or a date night."
205,"I was craving italian food and this place really hit the spot. I love how on a nice day in the city you can eat outside on the sidewalk area but even the inside is a vibe too.

207,"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate.

It was a Monday, so we got a table fairly quickly. What I tried:* Garlic Bread - This usually comes with 4 pcs, but our waiter added 1 more since we had 5 people. Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth. Would definitely come here again to try it with all of the different sauce options. Going to be adding this spot to my favorites and will be coming back again soon!"

We got the gnocchi, beef tar tar and seafood pasta. All so good. I would definitely come here again"
251,"good simple Italian fare with solid pastas and pizzas. no gimmicks needed, just the type of place you and a few friends would enjoy sunday dinner together family style.  Amatriciana was the standout here, no pancetta substitute here, guanciale all the way!Food: 8/10Value: 8/10Service: 7/10Vibe: 8/10"
252,"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit."
253,"The two times I've been here the pasta, bread and wine has been amazing. The first time I came here I got the truffle pasta. The second time I came here for a girls day early dinner. I got the walnut and pear tortellini and the truffle pizza it was amazing! My lovely date and i got an aperol sprit"
254,"First night in the bay and pasta sounded like a great idea. This place was so lively and fun and turned our ordinary Thursday into Thirsty Thursday. We ordered various pasta dishes and appetizers and they were all a bit smaller in size than we would have preferred, but still delicious nonetheness. Our waiters were so lovely, accomodating, a genuine joy to be around. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot for a lively atmophere."
255,"Be ready to become transported to Italy when entering. We came on a weekday afternoon, and luckily no wait. Very cute and trendy ambiance. So nice to take pictures of. Our servers were quick and food came out not too long afterwards Everything was so delicious. Craving their pasta as we speak. A must try in the city."
256,"I loved this spot, the staff working were so accommodating and friendly. The space itself is super cute, even tho we had the option to eat inside we chose to sit outside bc they had ample heaters and it can be tight and a bit noisy inside. I ordered the Branzino and i can't recommend it enough, seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. Will def be back for pasta next time."
257,"Their Friday and Saturday night hours extend to midnight now! Super lively energy even late at night (it's hard to find food spots open after 10pm in SF). Good vibes for parklet seating and indoor tables too Ordered the prosciutto burrata pizza in person for takeout, and it was really easy and only took 10 minutes for them to make! Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends."
258,"The ambiance here is spectacular and so is everything else! My friends and I grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited to get seated for our party of 5. It was a Monday, so we got a table fairly quickly. What I tried:* Garlic Bread - This usually comes with 4 pcs, but our waiter added 1 more since we had 5 people. Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth. Would definitely come here again to try it with all of the different sauce options. Going to be adding this spot to my favorites and will be coming back again soon!"
259,"First I would like to start off with the focaccia bread that they give complimentary, it's delicious! It's super fluffy and warm and great with the olive oil. The appetizers we got were pretty good as well and I got the truffle cream sauce with my pasta since i'm a huge truffle fan. The service was great as well and our server was really nice! They have outdoor and indoor seating, indoors is super cute but they do have heaters outside of indoor seating isn't available. Overall, Bottega is good and if you're going for classic pasta dishes to just satisfy ur pasta cravings I would recommend!"

You can add yourself to the waiting list before arriving.They serve complimentary focaccia break that you can dip in olive oil. The bread was alright but I always appreciate complimentary bread. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a black truffle creme sauce. It was divine!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was decadent! Would totally order it again. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't very friendly. He gave off moody ""I hate my job"" vibes. After handing my friends and I our dishes he quickly dashed off while I was mid sentence and never checked on us. We had to hunt down someone else for chili flakes and the check.

299,"I'm glad to say that Bottega lives up to its hype and isn't just for the aesthetics! If you're ever craving pasta, Bottega is the the place to be.SERVICE (1000/10): My mom and I loved our server Nicky! She radiates such a beautiful aura which went hand in hand with our first time experience at Bottega. I also do remember her vibing to Mama Mia with the table next to us. Truly iconic! Learning our preferences, mine was wanting a nice creamy pasta while my mom was craving something with seafood-- she was able to recommend 2 solid dishes. We ended both ended up getting the Pomodori Bruschetta for our appetizer, Sweet Dreams mocktail, along with the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce and the Pasta special for our entree. FOOD (8.5/10):- Bruschetta Pomodori: had a nice crunch to it, it was good but we've definitely had better. - Mezzemaniche Boscailo and Pasta special was truly delicious and didn't disappoint! I could say that the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection, the portions filled up and these both were packed with so much flavor! Sweet Dreams mocktail: Personally loved this drink so much, it kinda reminds me of an Orange creamsicle but in liquid form. So good! Delicious food and reasonable prices is what we all love! AMBIANCE (10/10): - So cute, clean and beautifully decorated! Perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls. Overall, I would say it was worth it and definitely be back.Side note: Parking is super limited due to it being street parking! Thankfully it wasn't an issue for us!"

Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends."
303,"The ambiance here is spectacular and so is everything else! My friends and I grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited to get seated for our party of 5. It was a Monday, so we got a table fairly quickly. What I tried:* Garlic Bread - This usually comes with 4 pcs, but our waiter added 1 more since we had 5 people. Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth. Would definitely come here again to try it with all of the different sauce options. Going to be adding this spot to my favorites and will be coming back again soon!"
304,"First I would like to start off with the focaccia bread that they give complimentary, it's delicious! It's super fluffy and warm and great with the olive oil. The appetizers we got were pretty good as well and I got the truffle cream sauce with my pasta since i'm a huge truffle fan. The service was great as well and our server was really nice! They have outdoor and indoor seating, indoors is super cute but they do have heaters outside of indoor seating isn't available. Overall, Bottega is good and if you're going for classic pasta dishes to just satisfy ur pasta cravings I would recommend!"
305,"The food is always delicious!  That said, last night's Sacchetti was pathetically small for the price. It didn't even cover the bottom of the take out container. It was barely an appetizer. Fortunately there was plenty of Mezzemaniche Boscaiola to share."

I would save my calories for main course- eggplant pasta which we customized to add grilled chicken and make the sauce spicy 5/5- vegana pizza - 4.5/5 - loaded with veggies and just the perfect amount of cheese and crispy !!- calamari 5/5 - loved that it came with some veggies in it and made fresh not oily calamari with a yummy pink dip- virgin mojito - skip it- valencia dream cocktail 4/5  - pink gin based yummy- sweet dreams - 5/5 sweater and the best one i liked- sunset cocktail - 4/5Sadly, the big black pepper (star of the restaurant) was broken and the new one was to come in by next weekend.

307,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant after seeing/hearing lots of great reviews. It's super cute and serves up many IG worthy pictures. Parking is obviously street parking. They have outdoor and indoor seating options. I was able to walk in without reservations. Love that they keep a wait time posted on their yelp. You can add yourself to the waiting list before arriving.They serve complimentary focaccia break that you can dip in olive oil. The bread was alright but I always appreciate complimentary bread. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a black truffle creme sauce. It was divine!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was decadent! Would totally order it again. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't very friendly. He gave off moody ""I hate my job"" vibes. After handing my friends and I our dishes he quickly dashed off while I was mid sentence and never checked on us. We had to hunt down someone else for chili flakes and the check. Regardless of the service I would return and probably try their pizzas next! They sound delish."

Learning our preferences, mine was wanting a nice creamy pasta while my mom was craving something with seafood-- she was able to recommend 2 solid dishes. We ended both ended up getting the Pomodori Bruschetta for our appetizer, Sweet Dreams mocktail, along with the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce and the Pasta special for our entree. FOOD (8.5/10):- Bruschetta Pomodori: had a nice crunch to it, it was good but we've definitely had better. - Mezzemaniche Boscailo and Pasta special was truly delicious and didn't disappoint! I could say that the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection, the portions filled up and these both were packed with so much flavor! Sweet Dreams mocktail: Personally loved this drink so much, it kinda reminds me of an Orange creamsicle but in liquid form. So good! Delicious food and reasonable prices is what we all love! AMBIANCE (10/10): - So cute, clean and beautifully decorated! Perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls.

We went in the evening on a Sunday night and were lucky enough to park right in front on the street.There is indoor and outdoor seating.

So sweet, charming, knowledgeable and overall kind. She gave great service that was fun and attentive, and was never overbearing. She had great recommendations that we didn't regret. The overall staff were extremely nice honestly. Unfortunately their fryer was down that night so we didn't get to try what we initially wanted, however I'm sure we'll both be back. What we ordered: Bruschetta Pomodori 5/5! Gnocchi with bolognese 3.5/5 Mezzelune Ai Porcini 5/5 A Hella Good (cocktail) 5/5 *I don't remember the name of mine but it was good as wellThe lemon cake dessert with mascarpone was pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular.

310,"I loved this spot, the staff working were so accommodating and friendly. The space itself is super cute, even tho we had the option to eat inside we chose to sit outside bc they had ample heaters and it can be tight and a bit noisy inside. I ordered the Branzino and i can't recommend it enough, seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. Will def be back for pasta next time."

319,"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!"

Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!"
338,"Love the food, ambiance and the service. Recommend the pink sauce pasta. Best place to celebrate your anniversary or bdays or any special occasion."
339,"Came here on a weekend for a late lunch. We had a group of 6 people and each of us ordered a different pasta, which was quite funny. We also got two dishes of the croquette (forgot what filling it had but it's pretty tasty!). I really like the interior (classy designs, big windows) too. Parking was not too bad (found some street parking on the block behind the store). Overall we had a good time dining here!"
340,"First I would like to start off with the focaccia bread that they give complimentary, it's delicious! It's super fluffy and warm and great with the olive oil. The appetizers we got were pretty good as well and I got the truffle cream sauce with my pasta since i'm a huge truffle fan. The service was great as well and our server was really nice! They have outdoor and indoor seating, indoors is super cute but they do have heaters outside of indoor seating isn't available. Overall, Bottega is good and if you're going for classic pasta dishes to just satisfy ur pasta cravings I would recommend!"
341,"The food is always delicious!  That said, last night's Sacchetti was pathetically small for the price. It didn't even cover the bottom of the take out container. It was barely an appetizer. Fortunately there was plenty of Mezzemaniche Boscaiola to share."
342,"I loved everything about this place :) we went with friends without a reservation and were immediately seated, so that was the first win! Friendly service, gorgeous ambiance and amazing decor. it has seating indoor and outdoor.In $130 (before tip) we got:- free bread 3/5 for the table with condiments . I would save my calories for main course- eggplant pasta which we customized to add grilled chicken and make the sauce spicy 5/5- vegana pizza - 4.5/5 - loaded with veggies and just the perfect amount of cheese and crispy !!- calamari 5/5 - loved that it came with some veggies in it and made fresh not oily calamari with a yummy pink dip- virgin mojito - skip it- valencia dream cocktail 4/5  - pink gin based yummy- sweet dreams - 5/5 sweater and the best one i liked- sunset cocktail - 4/5Sadly, the big black pepper (star of the restaurant) was broken and the new one was to come in by next weekend. Its still in the store so we saw it but not in usePS- they dont have air conditioning in the indoor seating just so u know!Clean cutlery and tables, full bar and chic seating. Definitely coming back for more. I think i will try their tiramisu next time.. stay tuned and ""Meet me at bottega"""
343,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant after seeing/hearing lots of great reviews. It's super cute and serves up many IG worthy pictures. Parking is obviously street parking. They have outdoor and indoor seating options. I was able to walk in without reservations. Love that they keep a wait time posted on their yelp. You can add yourself to the waiting list before arriving.They serve complimentary focaccia break that you can dip in olive oil. The bread was alright but I always appreciate complimentary bread. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a black truffle creme sauce. It was divine!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was decadent! Would totally order it again. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't very friendly. He gave off moody ""I hate my job"" vibes. After handing my friends and I our dishes he quickly dashed off while I was mid sentence and never checked on us. We had to hunt down someone else for chili flakes and the check. Regardless of the service I would return and probably try their pizzas next! They sound delish."
344,"I'm glad to say that Bottega lives up to its hype and isn't just for the aesthetics! If you're ever craving pasta, Bottega is the the place to be.SERVICE (1000/10): My mom and I loved our server Nicky! She radiates such a beautiful aura which went hand in hand with our first time experience at Bottega. I also do remember her vibing to Mama Mia with the table next to us. Truly iconic! Learning our preferences, mine was wanting a nice creamy pasta while my mom was craving something with seafood-- she was able to recommend 2 solid dishes. We ended both ended up getting the Pomodori Bruschetta for our appetizer, Sweet Dreams mocktail, along with the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce and the Pasta special for our entree. FOOD (8.5/10):- Bruschetta Pomodori: had a nice crunch to it, it was good but we've definitely had better. - Mezzemaniche Boscailo and Pasta special was truly delicious and didn't disappoint! I could say that the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection, the portions filled up and these both were packed with so much flavor! Sweet Dreams mocktail: Personally loved this drink so much, it kinda reminds me of an Orange creamsicle but in liquid form. So good! Delicious food and reasonable prices is what we all love! AMBIANCE (10/10): - So cute, clean and beautifully decorated! Perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls. Overall, I would say it was worth it and definitely be back.Side note: Parking is super limited due to it being street parking! Thankfully it wasn't an issue for us!"
345,"My friend randomly found this restaurant and I'm glad they did! We went in the evening on a Sunday night and were lucky enough to park right in front on the street.There is indoor and outdoor seating. Both were very cute with nice lighting and such, but we chose to sit inside at a window, which was perfect. Our server (I THINK her name is Julia) was AMAZING! So sweet, charming, knowledgeable and overall kind. She gave great service that was fun and attentive, and was never overbearing. She had great recommendations that we didn't regret. The overall staff were extremely nice honestly. Unfortunately their fryer was down that night so we didn't get to try what we initially wanted, however I'm sure we'll both be back.

349,"- Calling this my #1 favorite Italian restaurant- Friendliest and most attentive staff- Seats available inside and outside the restaurant- Dishes appear small, but it is filling- What is that amazing spicy sauce?- Walking distance from the 24th Mission street BARTI have tried a few Italian restaurants before, but none has truly given me a wonderful experience like this one. Actually, I'll compliment further, this was the best restaurant experience I ever had from any food category. The staff were the best at sharing us recommendations, special menus of the day, clearing the plates and tables, checking in from time to time to ask us if we are doing great, every aspect was so lovely.We arrived at the restaurant to have a delicious and good time, and Bottega delivered. I would like to give the rating 10+ stars if I could.Bottega has been in my bookmarks since I first saw the restaurant while walking around Valencia street. I love the warm and pretty interior decorations of flowers and the soft pink colors. I always recall the restaurant filled with people, so we decided to get there as early as possible. We entered 30 minutes after it opened and there were more seats than I last recall from my last visit in Valencia street. Along with tables, bar side tables, there is also outdoor seating.The staff welcomed us and asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside, and we opted for inside. The view from the inside is so pretty! The light from the outside is just right amount to filter through the tall windows. The staff handed us a menu; the front side is the food and the other side was the alcoholic drinks. I did wonder, hm, where is the coffee and the dessert, but that was well orchestrated by Bottega.While we were deciding, the staff mentioned about a special menu of minestrone soup or the pork chop, and we were intrigued with the minestrone soup. We ordered three dishes the Amatriciana, the prosciutto pizza (saw this from yelp photos), and the minestrone soup. As the food was being prepared, the staff asked if we were planning to share the dishes, and explained the unbelievably long pepper grinder we witnessed from a different guest.The minestrone arrived first and then the Amatriciana pasta. The staff came by and asked if we wanted more cheese, pepper, or the spicy sauce on the side. We asked for the spicy sauce on the side -- and yes, we needed to ask for more pepper. The pepper grinding was so cool and fun to stare at. xD I have a pepper grinder at home, but this one was almost as tall as a young child. Where did they sell these?The minestrone soup was very smooth and rich with flavor. My relative, who loves dishes with vegetables, praised this a lot and really enjoyed this soup. The vegetables in the broth were cooked so well, so soft, that light bites were enough. I might have wished we ordered another bowl, so we'll keep that in mind for next time.I was blown away with the spicy sauce when paired with the Amatriciana. What is that magic? There is a drastically amazing difference when tasting the pasta before adding the spicy sauce versus after. Before, it is good, but it also felt hefty. I sprinkled a little bit of the spicy sauce, and all of the sudden the flavors elevated and the dish became refreshing? It was like a magic transformation. Also, despite calling it the spicy sauce, it wasn't spicy even for me, who has low spice tolerance. The pasta noodle was cooked al dente, so there was an evenly smooth chew on each bite. The prosciutto pizza arrived while we were still eating and being amazed by the Amatriciana and the minestrone soup. It was cut in 8 pieces and each slice has prosciutto, cheese, and a cream that was particularly my favorite. It was milky and balanced out the salt from the prosciutto. On the first bite, I first tasted the salt, but it evened out in the end of the meal. Due to how thin the prosciutto is, this one was the hardest to eat out of the others. Prosciutto is not an easy piece to eat.We were feeling full, when the staff handed a petite dessert menu. Now, before this arrived, I told my family that if they offer me a dessert I will say ""yes,"" So, yes, we ordered dessert. Here, the staff explained the different desserts and pointed out the staff's favorite. I decided to go for the staff favorite, which was the third one in the list, after the panna cotta. (I tried my best to look by the search engine but I couldn't remember what it was called). We also ordered the panna cotta.The panna cotta was so good, the cream is so milky and melt into the mouth. I loved it a lot. Strawberry puree covered the top and the slightly sour and sweet strawberry complimented perfectly with it. Man, it was crazy because we were full moments ago, but the heaviness disappeared the moment we took a bite of the desserts.I also loved the other dessert. It is slightly heavier than the panna cotta, and I love the yellow custard.Yelp told me I'm at my word limit."

359,"Amazing! We wanted a good meal after attending an event and was happy to have discovered this place as a late night eatery. So glad I found it on Yelp because it did not disappoint! We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and was able to grab a seat instantly. They have indoor or outdoor seating, we chose inside. The ambiance is super cute with the pendant lights and floral decor. Even the dining chairs were cute. For drinks I ordered a sparking rosè. It was perfect, not too sweet, not too brut. To start we shared a ceasar salad. We told them that we wanted to share and they split it for us on two separate plates! That was super helpful and we definitely made note. I ordered the black truffle mushroom ravioli. It was great!!! I'm glad the hosts provided me with an idea on how good it would be. His recommendation did not disappoint. The flavor of the truffle was strong, which I like! The mushrooms were minced and paired good with the sauce and truffle. Highly recommend! Overall I will be dining here again for sure. Parking is limited to street but luckily I didn't have any issues finding one close by."
